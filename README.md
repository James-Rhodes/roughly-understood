# Roughly Understood

Welcome to Roughly Understood! My name is James and I am writing blog
posts on various topics from programming to physics to electrical
engineering.

People tend to over-estimate their knowledge on a topic. My goal here is
to show that every understanding of a topic is a rough understanding.
There is always another layer deeper we can go. I don't claim to be an
expert on any of these topics. However, I do wish to write about them
with the hopes that our rough understanding can become a little closer
to what is really going on. Potentially looking at the problem from new
and exciting perspectives.

If you find something on this site that you think could be written more
clearly, or something that is flat out wrong. Please feel free to open an issue on
this blogs GitHub Page.
