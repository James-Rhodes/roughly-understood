Have you ever wondered how you could send a message over the internet, have
that message traverse the globe only to be displayed on your friends screen no
matter how far away you are from each other? Well today, that's what we are
exploring.

I hope to take us from the application, where words turn to bits, through to
the protocols for reliable communication and finally all the way down into the
details of transmitting those bits through an antenna. 

So with that, lets get started!

## Some Context
In order to explain how the internet works I am going to describe it from the
perspective of a fairly common thing we all do. Sending messages to one
another. 

The idea is that we are going to follow how when you type the word "Hello" into
a web application, that message goes from your phone, across the world wide web
to be displayed on the screen of your friend as the simple message "Hello".

Now there are lots of ways this could actually occur in practice. Each
application could implement this differently, however we are going to just
explore a super simple model that uses HTTP requests to send the message. This
is **definitely** not how it is done in practice, because this requires the
receiver of the message to have to refresh their website/app to see if a
message has arrived. I think you will see that even this simple model
will give us plenty to talk about.

## The OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model is a cursed hyroglyphic that has
plagued university students for years... If I had to go through it then, I am
sorry, but now so do you. Unfortunately, like most things we are taught, the
OSI Model is actually quite a useful way of thinking about communication systems.

So to make the idea more concrete for those of us subjected to this model, I
hope that by explaining the end to end of the internet within this context, it
makes the OSI Model seem a little less obscure.

So what is the OSI Model? 

The OSI Model is a way about thinking about communication systems. It has 7
different layers within the model. These include:

TODO: OSI Model Picture
- Application Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer

Generally you can think of transmitting from one device to another as starting
at the application layer (where the message is typed). The data is then passed
down to the presentation layer, followed by the session layer and so on until
we reach the physical layer.

Receiving data is much the same as transmitting but just in reverse. So you
receive some data on the physical layer, pass that up to the data link layer
followed by the network layer and so on until it reaches the application layer
where you can see the actual contents of the message.

An important thing to note about the OSI Model is that each layer can only
communicate with the layers directly above or directly below itself. This means
that the physical layer cannot directly communicate with the application layer
without first going through the data link layer etc.

Now what the hell are "layers"? 

You can think of each layer as a chunk of code or even some hardware that
performs a given task. If we are reading the layers from the application layer
down, this task is generally to add additional information or alter the
existing data in some way. Once its processing is done, it then can give that
data to the next layer so that it can perform its processing. This is a
pipeline of sorts, we first perform some action at the application layer, this
outputs some data to the presentation layer which also performs some operation
on the data and so on until we finally hit the physical layer where we can
actually send the data off.

When we are looking at the OSI Model from the perspective of receiving some
data the same idea applies. However, instead of adding additional data, we are
stripping off the additional data until we get all the way back up to the
application layer where the message can be displayed to the user.

In the end I think Shrek said it best. The OSI Model is like an onion, it has
layers. I think it goes something like that anyway...
### Application Layer

### Presentation Layer

### Session Layer

### Transport Layer

### Network Layer

### Data Link Layer

### Physical Layer
